# C-TextEditor
A Text Editor in C

### Initial setup

I used WSL(Windows Subsystem for Linux) as the blog suggests using some kind of a Linux Environment.
Made sure that I had a C Compiler and `make` installed.

So far, to test the code, I am using the `Makefile` to build and run.

Run these commands:

```bash
make
./testy
```
